OpenFlexure Motor Controller PCB Design
=======================================
This aims to be a super-simple motor controller, based on an Arduino Nano and a couple of Darlington pair ICs.  It controls cheap 28BYJ-48 steppers, as used on the OpenFlexure microscope and stage.

This is the PCB that allows a Nano to control the microscope.  In the future we might include more breakouts to control LEDs etc.
